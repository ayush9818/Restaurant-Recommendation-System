# Restaurant-Recommendation-System


## Introduction

This project aims to develop a robust Restaurant Recommendation System that serves a dual purpose. For customers, it provides personalized restaurant suggestions based on individual preferences and geographical proximity. For restaurant owners, it offers a data-driven approach to generating targeted advertisements to attract customers effectively, leveraging insights from user reviews.

#### For Customers:
The system utilizes a sophisticated recommendation engine to curate a list of restaurants tailored to a user's tastes and dining history. By considering factors such as past reviews, preferences, and location data, the system ensures that users receive the most relevant and appealing recommendations.

#### For Restaurant Owners:
On the business front, restaurant owners benefit from an advanced data mining application that analyzes association rules within customer data. This facilitates the creation of impactful advertisements aimed at drawing in a crowd more likely to appreciate what the restaurant has to offer.

#### Technical Approach:
At the core of the recommendation engine is a hybrid model that combines the strengths of Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering. We use algorithms such as KNN, KNNWithMeans, and SVD for Collaborative Filtering and employ BERT embeddings and TF-IDF for Content-Based Filtering. The synergy of these techniques allows for a nuanced understanding of user preferences, leading to highly relevant recommendations.

#### Project Scope:
The Restaurant Recommendation System is an educational project designed to demonstrate the capabilities of modern recommendation algorithms. It handles a substantial dataset of approximately a million entries sourced from the publicly available Yelp dataset on Kaggle, making it a project that not only educates but also scales to real-world application scenarios.

Our mission with this project is to showcase how data-driven technologies can transform the dining experience for customers and the marketing efforts of restaurant owners.
