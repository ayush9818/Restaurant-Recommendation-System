You order at the counter and they deliver it.\\nMy daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower.

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we\\'d only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me \"I guess it would be fine\" and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the \"couldn\\'t be bothered\" vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. \\n\\nAlthough that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring \"last nights waiter\" wasn\\'t on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. \\nI also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing.

Raw oysters are not cleaned well. So if your schedule is flexible, go to Superior Seafood during their happy hours for their 50 cents/oyster - better quality and cheaper.

Unlike my fellow Yelp-ers, I would say that ther pizza is not their strong suit - its kinds greasy and not sure if they use 100% mozzarella - tastes like its cut with something cheaper. However, so far I've had:  \\n\\nThe Quaker (Chicken version) - Delicious. They make their chicken steaks with the chunky chicken, which I like much more than the shredded version. They could season the chicken more, but the cheese was melted perfectly and the veggies were fresh. \\n\\nThe fries - crisp and flavorful. I didn't even need ketchup, and I always eat ketchup on my fries\\n\\nThe onion rings - a little greasy, but very tasty and crisp. The onions stayed in the breading and didn't slide out when you bit them (which I hate). \\n\\nSpanakopita - mine was a little over cooked, but the flavors were really good\\n\\nBaklava - VERY GOOD! \\n\\nSignature Salad - The veggies they use are very fresh which will make or break a salad. Their balsamic is great too!\\n\\nThe (turkey) Greek Burger - one of the best turkey burgers I've ever had! The patty was moist and flavorful all on its own, but then they top it with what must be homemade tzatziki. I could eat a bowl of that stuff! My burger had romaine instead of the advertised arugula, but it was very fresh, so I didn't mind as much. I also asked for feta, which I didn't get, but that sauce made me forget all about it. \\n\\nOverall, this place is great!

It wasn't.  I'm in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don't have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I'm traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it's a hotel but there weren't any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you're so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you're in a city are pretty nonexistent.  \\n\\nThe property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn't know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  \\n\\nRoom: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn't there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I'm guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn't included....kind of necessary if you're staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she's being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord's legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn't told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  \\n\\nCheckout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you'd think they'd be plentiful and they aren't) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.\\n\\nI'm sure I'll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I'm not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff.\", 'date': '2013-08-03 16:26:48'}, {'review_id': 'kj5pjfid6pUP818rF0q6GQ', 'user_id': 'dWTrJdEPoZB8LkOPv_jxsA', 'business_id': 'cg4JFJcCxRTTMmcg9O9KtA', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"This was my first time dining at Ava and I enjoyed most of it.

First off, whenever I'm on my way to Sweet Divas, I can smell the spices wafting from this little, inviting shop. Second, they have such a large range of spices that you can smell, taste a little, and purchase. Yes, there's a large overwhelming variety of spices, but fear not! Their knowledgeable staff is available and more than happy to assist you in finding the right spice you are looking for all your cooking needs. Over the years I've purchased many items from here and I can attest that they do last a long time (about a year, year and a half, including some stuff I use often!). I see all kind of specialty salts for example (onion salt, celery salt) as well as sugars and powders (lavender vanilla sugar, vanilla bean powder). Their products even seem to taste fresher (I can taste a difference between their cinnamon and nutmeg and what I can get at a dollar store, for example). The prices aren't too bad and they last long. My three bottles pictured cost about $19, but that will last a good year, so its worth it to me.\", 'date': '2016-11-22 05:02:55'}, {'review_id': 'Oqh_qiy0kUEYY0IScSYTaQ', 'user_id': 'dCOonQ7Md1ooief37g1SHw', 'business_id': 'rrD5LY3nkyKMg1CYKKZomQ', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Steve & his partner are the best!

One bartender didn't even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn't have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they'd stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can't really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don't you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn't come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it's their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don't like it I can leave.  But if I'm there, it's my turf.  Don't come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don't like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.  You don't see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It's gross.  I probably just realized this, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town, but they have no machines at the bar.

I was in NJ early and decided to stop in for a delicious diner breakfast.  I got a taylor ham, egg, and cheese and a short stack of blueberry pancakes (I simply couldn't decide between sweet or savory, plus leftovers are never a bad thing).  \\n\\nThe egg sandwich was fantastic.  I was nervous when they said they didn't have kaiser rolls so I went with a hamburger roll.  It was an excellent decision.  The roll was excellent - not just an average cheap hamburger roll.  They layered the cheese on the sandwich, which to me is a must for a true egg sandwich.  It was served with home fries, which were sauteed with large slices of peppers and onions.  I'm not the biggest breakfast potatoes fan, but these were great and I appreciated that they didn't clearly just scoop some food from a huge pile of pre-cooked home fries.\\n\\nThe pancakes were great and fluffy.  My one gripe was their use of smuckers pre-packaged syrup.  I realize that if they put syrup in a container, it probably wouldn't be real maple syrup, but I sort of wish I didn't know that they were giving me sub-par syrup.\\n\\nThe server was friendly and very attentive.  The coffee refills were constant, and the coffee was actually good (so many diners fail at coffee).

It was objectively a horrible experience, even without comparing it to the hype it receives, and ruined what was supposed to be a nice birthday dinner celebration. \\n\\nWe had a group of 8 that had a reservation made well in advance. Short wait, but not too bad. Keep in mind, it seemed like a normal Friday night, but weren't super busy or at-capacity.\\n\\nIt was a birthday dinner, so I told the hostesses that it was her birthday, and asked if they could bring out something for her at the end of the meal, which was acknowledged. Pretty standard stuff, whether at a Applebee's or the French Laundry. We were sat at a booth right next to the Maitre D' stand, and next to all the wait staff's home base, so pretty much no excuse for not getting any attention. \\n\\nAfter getting us waters, it took them a LONG time to even come by and acknowledge us. After ordering wine, it took them another good 15-20 minutes to even bring us our wine, and no one even checked in on us! (hint: if you're running a restaurant, wine is your profit center and doesn't take any work other than taking a bottle off a shelf and opening it. bring it out ASAP...). \\n\\nAfter ordering food, it was more of the same...a long wait for food to start coming out and no one checking in on us AT ALL. We drank the bottles we ordered and had to get up and flag someone down to get another wine order. A couple of us even got up during the meal to remind them to bring out something for birthday girl at the end of the meal. \\n\\nOnce our meal was done and taken away, we were given dessert menus and the server disappeared for 10-15 minutes... AGAIN. After coming back, he asked what dessert we wanted, so we ordered some coffees... and waited... and waited. Eventually we got up and asked him what was going on and if they were going to bring anything out like we asked multiple times. \\n\\nThey finally brought out a couple of cookies with a candle...\\n\\nIn summary, the food was pretty hit or miss, pretty mediocre for this price point. Whipped feta, like other reviews have said, was amazing, and the Braised Lamb was really good. But the Sirloin was chewy and bland and the Grilled Caesar tasted like a soggy, luke-warm, wilted mess (two orders were left untouched by a group of 8). Atmosphere was nice and trendy. But the service, which is a huge reason to spend your hard-earned $ at a restaurant, was absolutely horrendous. \\n\\nI really love going to cool, popular restaurants and having a great time, and I hate writing such a negative review, but I had to share my experience, especially for a restaurant that is getting an awful lot of (undeserved) hype.\", 'date': '2017-09-09 00:09:15'}, {'review_id': 'mcl6XhpC7hoUqkTJcmUpkw', 'user_id': 'ZjzvfgBP9F3hfGMpHsCozw', 'business_id': 'WO5nr-4sjVs506BdCLL0aA', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Great food for the price. \\nTender steak and perfectly cooked shrimp. \\nWould certainly come back.', 'date': '2016-11-09 23:40:11'}, {'review_id': '6d9hz8LsjvkXjViPW4xaRA', 'user_id': 't77iaBQb3pyj2rtwffiLEg', 'business_id': 'ZnAr0AxYpEYK1ZHNc4fk7g', 'stars': 2.0, 'useful': 4, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'We stopped at Tako due to the positive reviews on yelp.

Therefore, I would have to sell the car back to the dealership as a used car.  I would lose a lot of money in doing this.

Iris excels in every area: food, drinks, service, atmosphere, location, music and overall graciousness. I made the reservation for 10-15 people, not knowing exactly how many in my party would show up. Iris pulled out all the stops to make sure everyone had comfortable seating and even prepared an overflow table for us. At no time did we feel jostled or rushed, which is a common fine dining concern. \\n\\nThe layout of the restaurant allowed diners to move freely to and from the table and to exchange seats as needed. The music selection was fun and unique, ranging from the Magnetic Fields to Johnny Cash. It was also quiet enough to be enjoyed while allowing conversation to flow unimpeded. Our waiter had excellent timing and anticipated our every need. \\n\\nThough they don't have a full drink menu for lunch (I hear they have an amazing mixologist for the dinner hour) they do offer a selection of martinis and wines. One of the guests has accounts with several high-end bars in the Quarter, and the drink list passed his muster. Our table settled for Chardonnays, Perseco and chilled shots of Chartreuse, though I hear they have several types of absinthe as well. \\n\\nOur group began with slices of warm, heavenly bread that Iris bakes in house. We continued with an assortment of salads--I had the Hollygrove arugula with warm goat cheese, niçoise olives and balsamic vinaigrette. It was fresh perfection. A few of us opted for the mussels, which I heard were delicious. For my main course, I had a wonderful drum with onions prepared in a tangy soy reduction, which was an elegant complement for the fish. I also heard rave reviews about the gnocci and chicken. \\n\\nAll the entrees were creatively arranged and selected, and at no point did I feel overwhelmed or that any fuss or pretense had gone into the food. I also appreciated that the portions were European-sized (it always makes me laugh when other Americans list too-small portion size as a complaint even when the food is well-prepared!). Iris prepares a lot of their basic ingredients in-house, and I appreciate that the kitchen makes a point of incorporating gulf fish and produce purchased from local, farmer-friendly markets. \\n\\nWe settled on the prix fixe menu, which was $20 a person for appetizer, main course and the dessert of the day (the best strawberry sorbet I have had yet).

Their biggest mistake is not having a customer service department. They rely on their sales team to provide customer service meaning every time you call in to try and get something done, you get put into a voicemail because the sales guy is out selling - which should be their only job. This left me on numerous occassions incredibly frustrated that I could not get an answer. I even left the manager a voicemail (big surprise I couldn\\'t get them to answer) and they never had the decency to call me back - Just made my sales person call me back.\\n\\nI purchased my car last July and was promised numerous things would be done to the car before I purchased it. One of which being the tint on the rear window would be removed as the view out of the back was blurry. Somehow, that passed thru inspection and when I came to sign the papers, I noticed that it was still on the back windshield. I was told that they would have it removed by the time we were done the paperwork. Also, I was told that the price was going to be higher than the original agreement because the sales manager did the math wrong the previous day when we ran numbers. I told him that wasn\\'t my fault and I would only pay the agreed upon amount and he spoke with the manager and got it sorted out. \\n\\nAfter sitting in the office for 2.5 hours, they finally told me that they were unable to even start taking off the tint and I would have to bring the car back. I dropped it off that Friday and let them keep it for the weekend. My sales guy called me on Saturday night to tell me that they never got to finish it and I would have to bring it back again and leave it. I live 45 minutes from the dealership so this isn\\'t something I can easily do. I insisted on them giving me a loaner car for whatever day they would do this as I was sure this wouldn\\'t be a one day process from my previous experience. 2.5 weeks later they were able to provide me with said car and I dropped off my vehicle. When I went to pick up my \"finished car\" there was still tint left on the bottom of the windshield. \\n\\nAfter all of that I knew I would never bring my car back for service there if that\\'s the kind of service they provide. Now with all the rain we\\'ve been having, my trunk is leaking and when I called to check with the service department to see if it would be covered under warranty, I got the same run around with the service department who just said \"I don\\'t know\" - OK well give me someone who will be able to tell me. Once they forwarded me to the correct person, I again got \"I don\\'t know\". We need you to bring it in and look at it then submit to our warranty company to see if it gets accepted. No thanks after my previous experience of bringing my car in there to get \"serviced\". \\n\\nInvest in a customer service department to handle complaints in a professional and timely matter. This should not in any way be left upon the sales department to do. My sales guy did the best he could and I appreciated the help he gave me, but no one else would help me throughout the entire process.

Pollo a la brasa.... Rotisserie chicken.... Whatever you wanna call it.... I call it a technique done here with love and pride. Lets be clear, you will find no comparison coming from your grocer deli section or at the checkout isle.\\n\\nWhy do I think this chicken have some TLC put into it? On biting down of this chicken you can note seasoning flavors down to the bone. This is an inclination that prior to even getting into the rotisserie oven, these birds spend some time in some form of marinating process. Building flavor, the chicken also has a seasoning rub all over the skin.\\n\\nLets go to this rotisserie oven. Another unique element is this oven has a charcoal or grill like component. This gives the chicken a smoky element in the flavor build. As these birds turn in this oven, they keep moist from the natural drippings dropping from bird to bird as they rotate through this oven. In turn, this a reason why some people may note some pieces the skin end up dry and crispy and others get moist or soggy skin on their chicken In the end, you end up with this tender, smoky, well seasoned, fall off the bone goodness. Wait.... how can they add more flavor? Cuenelli's serves it with two dipping sauces, a chimichurri  which gives a herbaceous and slightly spicy flavor, and an aioli which has a garlicky - lemony element.\\n\\nRound out this meal with some solid sides. Must haves for me would be the cilantro rice. Another herbaceous addition that works well with this meal. I got to use the word herbaceous a few times in this review, it has reflects such great imagery for food talk:) Must have beans with rice no? I pick the spicy pinto beans over the black beans at this establishment but lets be clear these beans are pretty spicy. I also love the maduros here. These sweet plantatains are cooked to perfection where the outsides has this caramelization from the natural sugar of the sweet plantain, leaving you with this toffee-like, stick to your tooth exterior and soft and sweet interior. \\n\\nWash all down with Inca cola or a bottle of chicha limena.  Inca cola is almost like a cola champagne or a cream soda type of drink. Chicha Limena I say is Christmas in a bottle. This juice has a floral base blended with cinnamon and cloves.\\n\\nThough Cuenelli's Peruvian Style Rotisserie Chicken have many other notable Latin dishes, the one thing that comes to mind to me is this chicken made with love. This chicken gives new meaning to all who thought they knew what rotisserie chicken is. I say, go to Cuenelli's and taste again for the very first time.\", 'date': '2013-11-14 01:23:03'}, {'review_id': 'RNf8aUDzK2wzzO7sVzIkbQ', 'user_id': 'xjQSpme1Z7Xw8XehRLpYuA', 'business_id': 'EtKSTHV5Qx_Q7Aur9o4kQQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"fuck yes. meat, bourbon libations, and a salad (to round things out aka make myself feel better about ingesting the aforementioned two items.) i took myself on an early birthday date with myself and was not disappointed (neither in the food nor the company). i had a medium rare plain burger to see if it was worth all the fuss...no cheese, bacon, dressing, etc to disguise the quality of the meat.

My beautiful wife and I arrived right at 730. Although there were two vacant tables available, it took them at least 10 minutes or so to seat us. And when they did, they broke up a table for 6 instead of putting us at the 2 seater. Odd.\\n\\nBeing out and away from the kids for a few hours, we wanted at least a little bit of privacy, instead of sitting next to (pretty much connected to) a table of four. We asked the manager if we could be moved to the 2 seater...he said fine. Another 5-10 minutes (too long!) later a member of the wait staff came and, without any indication as to his intentions, whisked up our bottle of wine and silverware and ran off to the other table. Not a problem, but some eye contact and a simple 'follow me please' with even a hint of a smile would have been lovely. We shrugged and just rolled with it.\\n\\nThe interior is quaint, and the lighting is dim. It's a nice place for a romantic meal. But it is LOUD. So loud I would say this place is kid friendly despite being in such close quarters with your neighbors. Not sure if we'd ever try taking our four kids there (actually I'm certain we won't) but one or two can be done without much trouble.\\n\\nOur waitress was extremely polite and offered the energy and enthusiasm that our other friend lacked.\\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered a caesar salad to share and for our main courses my wife opted for her usual tagliatelli with mushroom cream sauce and i had what i always have, the tortellini pasticiatti.\\n\\nComplimentary with the meal were two pieces of bruschetta (very nice) and a small loaf of crusty Italian bread, which is served with butter packets (which perhaps only I find strange for an Italian restaurant?). \\n\\nOverall the food was delicious, except for a few somewhat minor hiccups: \\n\\n1. The caesar salad was served on a warm plate. The salad was excellent and would have been legendary had it been served on a chilled (or at least not warm!) plate.\\n\\n2. I am pretty sure they used frozen peas in the tortellini dish, which is fine with me as long as you make sure the peas are thawed before you serve it! Only a few peas were not quite thawed, but it marred what was otherwise a perfectly crafted masterpiece of a dish.\\n\\nWhen we paid, the manager allowed us to use an expired gift card. That was a very nice gesture and one that required no push from us to induce.\\n\\nAll in all, I'll keep visiting Fellini because it's relatively inexpensive and they do most everything well.\", 'date': '2012-07-16 17:27:36'}, {'review_id': 'GXlrpVd8rnL8gMgxczbd1g', 'user_id': 'q-EBNzv_YO5CE0Q_Ln7D5Q', 'business_id': 'vOgQnvKbE4nMopFTjoL8Gg', 'stars': 2.0, 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Pretty bummed I didn't try out the Catbird Seat, because this place was totes underwhelming.

I visited Stitch-It in June 2013\\n\\nIn brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn\\'t mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nComplete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn\\'t have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn\\'t give me the warm and fuzzies.  \\n\\nStitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said \"I can hem the bottom....I\\'d have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won\\'t touch that with a 10ft. pole!\"  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  \\n\\nI contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who\\'s name I can\\'t remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O\\'Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.

My favorite breakfast item is Carly's breakfast. Avocado on sourdough toast with a fried egg and sweet potatoes. Sooo good!

Like an all too familiar pattern, I go back to Mohammad Butt, my main man for marsala.\\nBut whats this? \\nThere are whispers that he no longer cooks for \"Best Taste of Asia,\" that he is gone, never to return; some sort of falling out.\\n\\nNo.\\nNo, it can\\'t be! \\nI need to score - one .. final .. hit..\\n\\nLife ceases to have meaning, existential murmurings dog the mind. Who am I?\\nWhy am I here?\\nWhat is Cheeze Wiz?\\nIts done, over, a round falls into the chamber and just as I prepare to end it all and pull the trigger- steps in ZAIKA.\\n\\nZaika - meaning the art of taste -  stays to to its name. This is a place where the Paneer (cheese) is made fresh in house, resulting in a cheese that\\'s silky in texture. Especially when in contrast to the prepackaged rubbery bone-white LEGO blocks most small Indo-Pak places purchase from Indian Grocers in attempts to reduce prep-times. While at Zaika such shortcuts are not taken,  the Chef takes the extra steps needed to ensure a dish comes together as a whole. For example, the Chicken Makhani uses Smokey Tandoori Chicken, which I have never seen done before but it certainly aids the chicken to cut though the rich buttery tomato sauce and elevates the dish as a whole. Even entrées like Dall Fray or  Palak Paneer  have so much flavor that they will leave you not missing animal protein in the least should you choose to go the vegetarian route. \\n\\nZaika \\'s appetizers, like the Veggie Samosa and Aloo Tikki, (spiced potato patties) are generally large, peppery and well spiced - the latter of which remind me of something my own mother would make. Though I must warn others to avoid the items that occasionally pop-up as specials like the potato stuffed chili peppers, unless they have a iron stomach or are a gluten for punishment. These peppers are spicy, not deveined or even seeded. Further, I find the fish pakora to be far too fishy.\\n \\nI\\'ve become rather taken by Zaikia. Even the simply things such as the naan are good there. Just right in elasticity, the bread does not have too much give and yet isn\\'t too soft. It\\'s nothing elaborate, just properly risen with a light texture and  no egg or yeast flavor. The only complaint being that it lacked that signature faint sweetness naan has. But hey, I use it mostly for mopping up the other good stuff on the plate anyway and the sweetness gets lost in the mix, so I don\\'t mind at all.\\n\\nThe menu has nearly 120 different items, all numbered to order by, making take-out phone orders convenient and should eliminate any fears anyone should have of a language barrier problem. Furthermore, it has short descriptions of each dish - something all ethnic places like this should have.\\nThough some items like Lassie (a frothy yogurt drink) do not appear on the menu, that too is offered - both a salty and sweet mango verities. \\nThe head chef speaks English quite well and should be easy to deal with should you want to inquire more or want to setup large orders.\\n\\nI have already noticed parties negotiating catering for Ramadan as I anxiously awaited my own order.\\n\\nThe bottom line here is this, Mohammad Butt has expanded on the menu he once created for \"Best taste of Asia,\" and taken an all HALAL meat approach. \\n\\nOnly good things can come of this, only good things.\\n\\nP.S.\\nZAIKA is right behind Nifty Fifties on Grant Ave., so you are all set for dessert should you want a milkshake. \\nHowever, I would suggest getting the Ras Malai if available. These riccotta cheese dumplings flouting in soaked in sweetened, thickened milk are delicately flavored with cardamom, a very some amount of rose water and then garnished with pistachios.

We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. \\n\\nWe ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn't scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. \\n\\nAfter our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn't have a good flavor to it. \\n\\nI ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn't mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don't know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn't a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend's steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn't particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn't come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. \\n\\nAnyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous.

We arrive at the Sake House at 4pm. There is only one other table and they were closing out. We sit down, and I immediately ask for a simple ice water with lemon. Waiter comes back 20 minutes later (no water). I order a simple roll for my son, to get him started  and a cold Sake. I said I will wait to order mine to get him settled. Another 30 min later, still no water, no food. Waiter comes back with hot Sake, instead of cold. 20 minutes later, the roll for my son (not how I asked) finally some cold Sake, then I have to request water, and then only one cup for my son, no lemon. When I see 2 going on a third table had come in and ordered, and a \"to go\" order is being placed, all with food and water, I became perturbed. The waiter never came back to see what I wanted. Never came back to check on the order. Finally after  nearly 2 hours of waiting and trying to deal with my antsy son, who waited so long to be served, and seeing one chef trying to make everyone\\'s order I decided it was time to go. Finally after waiting another 5/10 minutes I had to walk up and ask for my check , which was only a $6 drink. Which I reluctantly paid. After being in the hospitality industry for years, I know what to expect, and I know what to forgive. I also know that English being a second language must be tough...BUT since he was able to wait in other tables i know that wasn\\'t the issue.

I liked the food, but you always have to have the first visit to see \"how they do things\" and figure out what your preferences will need to be.\\n\\nI did use their living social deal so I brought my dad in when he came in from out of town to try it out with me. I like the set up, the quaint house is cute (and well, quaint), but I can see how it wouldn\\'t be ideal it if was jam packed. I imagine you could potentially do family style for some of the pub height tabletops. I did call ahead to make sure that I didn\\'t need to print out the coupon and it could be used from my ipod and to make sure they were open, as the website said to just double check.\\n\\nWe started with shrimp spring rolls, probably the best I\\'ve had, the ingredients seemed fresher, and crispier. No shredded lettuce here. Simple and loosely wrapped, but you could taste the individual components. The peanut sauce was tasty too, though they don\\'t have sirracha (spelling?) to add to it, just dried pepper flakes. \\n\\nWe then got the tom yum (gai?) with shrimp. I know it is hot (because of the name, duh), I usually prefer it a little less spicy (I am white), though I still got a good sour flavor (for instance at Thai chili it\\'s too hot for me, I don\\'t taste any sour). I usually get my tom yum without meat or seafood because I feel the meat gets dried out, but the server assured me the shrimp wouldn\\'t be overcooked, and they weren\\'t. I think they are making sure to use fresh ingredients, but I do prefer straw mushrooms (I think they are usually canned) over the button mushrooms they used. Next time I am probably going to try out a veggie version (i love the soup with the cabbage, and broccoli). The owner did tell me they are trying to be authentic and so maybe button mushrooms and less veggies is more authentic?\\n\\nWe then got shrimp pad thai and chicken pad keo mao (drunken noodle) minus the red pepper. Both were tasty, the portions were probably a little less than other places in Reno (not sure if just lunch sized portion now that I think about it).\\n\\nLike Ernie said, the pad thai noodles were a little soft, overdone, and its not the \\'orange-y\\' sauce like other pad thai\\'s, but there was still flavor there. The shrimp were also tasty in this dish. The drunken noodles was done exactly how I like them, lots of baby corns and the noodles covered in the sauce and of course spicy. \\n\\nMy dad and I talked outside for a while and the husband did come out and talk with me about the food, and asked if I was happy (we were outside a while). I hope the living social deals bring in some business, and I do plan on coming back, it is just hard because I don\\'t live in the area. I also asked about the cooking classes (they are a steal at $65), and on facebook it said they are looking to improve and give some focus to that side of the business. The owner did say that they use just a regular kitchen so no woks or anything like that (meaning what they teach us can actually be done at home), I wonder if that is why the pad thai noodles are that way? Regardless, they seem to pride themselves on authentic and quality food and service.\\n\\nI did include pictures. Oh I did try a thai iced tea for the first time too, pretty tasty, reminded me of chai tea. \\n\\nI didn\\'t get to see the bill closely, but it was $24 and some change after the living social deal (takes $20 off), I didn\\'t think that was too bad for 2 for lunch (the total cost), with an appetizer and soup and a drink.', 'date': '2013-06-24 09:58:07'}, {'review_id': 'MIvAWbDNBsj5veOvsftNgw', 'user_id': '758g6NGLp9deCbvowz62Ww', 'business_id': 'z6SVTb9eFIcWVpKXIfFEvQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Sometimes I just head on over to Kingsway if I need a little shopping fix, instead of battling the crowds at West Ed.

I visited on 3/8/13 and got their \"Mini Manicure\"- it\\'s only $15!  I chose an OPI polish and the nail technician did a GREAT job!  So great in fact, that today on Monday, 3/18/13- I did not have ONE CHIP!  This is amazing for polish!  My nails looked fabulous!  The technician was friendly, as were the other stylists.  I\\'m not sure if it was the manager or the owner that was working the front desk- but she came over as well and was super friendly and welcoming.  The salon looks amazing, trendy, and peaceful.  It has a great vibe.\\n\\nI was so happy with my first appointment- that I went back today, and left disappointed.  I went to the same nail techinician- and we talked as she worked on my nails.  The person working the front desk (seemed like an owner/ manager- although different from my first visit) was SO  nice, welcoming, and talkative.  This time though I needed a gel manicure, in french- as I am in a wedding this weekend.  I explained that I was in the wedding, assuming the technician would know that this more special than just an everyday manicure  The technician stated after she started my nails, that she did not have the proper brush that she needed in order to do the manicure.  So like most places- they paint the white, and then go back later with a brush to create the crisp, perfect line.  Since she did not have the brush to do that- she used a q- tip.  So obviously the lines are not perfect or even.  Along with the lines being uneven- some are thicker than others, and the edges go up, instead of down.  My nails are not at all filed and shaped pretty either.  For $40 (+ a tip)- I really expect them to look right.  I went during my lunch hour, and it was supposed to be 30 minute appointment, but the appointment took a little bit over an hour.  I understand that french takes a little extra time- but this seemed like quite a bit extra.  I was late for work, and had to hurry out of there when she was finished and did not want to be even more late to work to stay there to make a complaint.  I wish I would have- but I also felt bad because the technician was trying so hard- but they are just not up to par.\\n\\nI\\'m conflicted, but I don\\'t know that I\\'ll return.  I loved it to so much the first time, I even sent friends over there.  But after this time- I am not happy with the product.  I wish it wasn\\'t gel- because I can\\'t even take the polish off myself.

The sounds of the game will get their attention.  They came to a sports bar to think about sports, not Conway Twitty.\\n\\nTypically, when I see the word pub in a restaurant name, I think it is just beer and wine, but it looks like Timeout has a full bar with several specialty drinks.

I got a message from the owner saying he\\'d like to have me come in to receive a FREE service because they previously ruined my hair. So, I thought since he\\'s the owner my hair would turn out good but I was wrong. I\\'m really unhappy with this whole experience. I showed him multiple photos on google of what I wanted done to my hair which was a lot of blonde. I told him I do not want any ORANGE in my hair as I wanted a \"white blonde\". He said you won\\'t have any orange in your hair. I have a message from him the OWNER saying I would receive a FREE service if I deleted my previous review. He should of NEVER offered a free service if it wasn\\'t really free! So, I said how much because I thought I was getting my hair done for free. He said since your hair is long and thick you\\'ll have to pay for the hair color and \"medicine\" but he won\\'t charge me for his time. I said ok how much he said $80. He said it would cost me $180 if he didn\\'t give me a discount which is very pricey. He put a lot of highlights on my hair and worked quickly as he seemed to want to rush on my hair which I do not like. My hair is important to me, I don\\'t want my hair to fall out. He said this medicine he\\'s gonna put on my hair is $50 for a treatment and that I needed it because of the blonde going on my hair which I know any coloring is damaging and blonde is very damaging but he said he charges everyone who gets hair color for this so called medicine which they mix into the color you dye your hair. You can purchase the entire set online (3 bottles) for $75 which is supposed to give you like 15 applications so he\\'s definitely charging a lot of money! He only put No.1 on my hair and not No.2 or No.3. He also had a lady (the receptionist) wash out my hair? Ok, even though she was nice why would he have her do that when she said she knows nothing about hair because I asked if she\\'s styling my hair and she said she doesn\\'t do hair and I wouldn\\'t want her to do my hair. As I was waiting there was a lady next to me, she got her hair cut and a perm. She was done but she wasn\\'t happy, she told the lady she didn\\'t like the hair cut and she had her style it more and trim off a little more but the lady still wasn\\'t happy. The girl told the client when she washes her hair it will be better.. um how? I know she left very unhappy! Also the lady behind me was getting her hair cut and when he (the owner) was done cutting her hair she looked in the mirror and wanted it different and styled different so that made me have to wait longer but 2 clients were not happy and also myself. That\\'s not a good look TJ nail and spa! I had a towel on my head and waited about 30 mins just to get my hair blow dried because he was cutting another clients hair. I seen orange roots, I was mad!!! He finally came over and I said I don\\'t like the orange color on my roots, can you put a toner on my hair and he said it\\'s not orange it\\'s the lighting. The lighting?! It wasn\\'t the lighting! He proceeds to blow dry hair and then starts straighten it without asking me if I wanted it straightened or curled, you are supposed to pick how you want your hair styled. At that point I knew my hair wasn\\'t what I wanted and it wasn\\'t gonna be fixed even if I wanted it too. I just sat there in the hair, mad and yet again very disappointed! I looked in the mirror and seen my hair damaged and brittle, orange and brassy and not even close to what I wanted. There goes my money down the drain, yet again. I will not be back to get my hair ruined and he made me delete my previous review which was also 0-1 stars before I left his salon but I had to write this one, this is real, this is honest, beware of getting your hair completely ruined and nothing close to what you want! Like I said I showed the OWNER multiple photos and I stated I did NOT want any orange on my hair but I did have orange on my hair, I didn\\'t get what I wanted like he said, he said he doesn\\'t mess up, he\\'s been doing hair for years. As a salon owner I think he should take the time to really do what the client wants and achieve what the client wants done to their hair, if the workersowner would do that then there shouldn\\'t be any bad reviews but there is so that shows you they do not care, not even the owner cares. They just want to rush and get done to get paid, they don\\'t care if the customer is happy or not. There are more bad reviews from people going to this salon and having horrible experiences but he is bribing people to delete their bad reviews because he told me the bad reviews is hurting his business which is why people do reviews, to let people know this place is awesome or this place is horrible, beware, stay away. I do reviews to let people know the good, the bad and the ugly. I do reviews anywhere and I\\'m always 100% honest.

I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! \\n\\nWe first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.\\n\\nThe looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.\\n\\nWhat I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. \\n\\nThe attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.\\n\\nFive stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here.\", 'date': '2015-12-20 21:47:02'}, {'review_id': 'XDAv3vVYTwCOhGAeeNLXsg', 'user_id': 'w90KNnzS6Ao3k-njRlCEeA', 'business_id': '2bl6G1zgXUHbMGwEocqMSg', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Dave was very nice and explained the menu, the dogs were whipped up fast and were delicious, hit the spot.

My first exposure to his succulent birds was the hot chicken at The Fat Ham. Lo and behold, his lavender honey fried chicken tops its spicy cousin. The chicken is brined in buttermilk, dredged in seasoned flour and sits for ten minutes. It's then coated with a second round of flour and dropped into the fryer. The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy, crispy coating on the outside with a juicy, moist inside. The sweet honey glaze is truly outstanding and finger lickin' good. The biscuit is awesome. I would definitely order this dish again and again. I got the salty but delicious fried smelts with chili pepper aioli as an appetizer.

We came prepared with reservations, but the restaurant actually began quieting out while our delicious meal was ramping up; the tables offer more elbow room than the photographs online belie.  As the name of the evening suggests, no menu is in play here; you\\'ll let your friendly server know if you have any food allergies or particular preferences, and before long watch your customized meal unfold.  That\\'s a three-course meal, $30, plus $12 for three half-glass wine pairings.\\n\\nAs starters, we were served lamb meatballs -- likely the favorite of the night -- and goat cheese-stuffed poblano peppers.  The peppers had a good bit of spice offset by the chalkiness of the goat cheese, making an excellent pairing for my Soave (white wine).  The mains were a corvina fish delicately cooked in wax paper and a swordfish steak served over asparagus with homegrown tomatoes and \"love sauce.\"  The corvina came out on the rarer side, perhaps a little too complex for this Midwesterner\\'s palate, but the hearty swordfish was some of the best seafood I\\'ve tasted in Missouri.  Dessert comprised a champagne gelatin and a chocolate tart, both of which were topped by fluffy homemade whipped cream and quickly eaten.\\n\\nThe staff at Home Wine Kitchen made our visit pleasant, acting casual yet professional during our meal.  The restaurant patrons seemed to be largely industry types that oohed and aahed about the cuisine (perhaps a trifle self-importantly, but this Yelper is no saint himself).  I was surprised to note that other diners were served the same courses as we were (albeit in different configurations), when I was under the assumption there would be a little more variation; however, I can only imagine the challenge such an endeavor would pose to the talented kitchen.  The interior, lighting, and volume here were all very good.\\n\\nBy the end of the evening, we realized that putting yourself in the hands of the chef is not for the faint of heart, as evidenced by one conversation near us during the meal that all but stopped when a beautiful whole fish was served to the table.

Today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles!\\n\\nWe won't be back.\", 'date': '2013-12-06 23:35:16'}, {'review_id': '39n06H82AMK1_bOPGJJHug', 'user_id': 'Y1T7sd4TKOe4utqV5hFdMQ', 'business_id': '7UtzYHLViVa5WJW992f3fg', 'stars': 3.0, 'useful': 2, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'text': \"I could say that this is a touch of Italy in a strip mall, but even I recognize that is a little too precious. Stepping into the dark, cool interior of Sapore made for a refreshing change after the sweltering July heatwave. It was no problem for our party of three to be seated; the fact that we had a reservation helped, I am sure. We started out with drinks--bellinis for my two dinner companions and a classic vodka martini for me. I appreciated being able to customize my drink with a blue-cheese-stuffed olive and an anchovy. I would never have thought to put an anchovy in a martini, but it looks like this will be a new obsession for me. \\n\\nOn to the food. We opted to skip the appetizers and go straight to soup/salad and entrees (all the better to save room for dessert). My mom went with the Italian soup and my other dining companion and I split the Caprese salad, a solid presentation that did not blow me away, but certainly does not provide grist for anything like the negative reviews of this establishment that I have seen on yelp. I didn't know what to expect in terms of pasta portions here, so I went with the Chicken Marsala. It might have been nice to have pasta to pick up some of the sauce, but I appreciated that the dish was hot by temperature and I even had enough for leftovers (to which I added pasta, in the comfort and convenience of my home).\\n\\nThe dessert selection was excellent. We went with the tiramisu. I understand Sapore also has an excellent cannoli which I would like to try on a future visit.

Upon arriving, you are immediately welcomed with the scent of fresh baked cookies. Walking up to the desk we were greeted by Valorie who informed us that cookies and water were complementary to guests and that we were more than welcome. Across from the desk we noticed a book shelf. This is not the kind of book shelf where rejected leftovers were placed but rather, a wide range of books by well known authors. The name of the program was called Read it and Return. In essence, you can borrow a book for the duration of your stay and if you don't finish it you can return it the next time you stay at the hotel at any of the Carlson hotels who have the same program! ( what!?! Cookies and books!?! YES!) Right off the bat, we felt like we were right at home.\\n\\n   Arriving at our room, we noticed that everything was extremely clean and there was a refrigerator (with a small freezer) , a microwave, a coffee maker, and a well working A.C. (you know, the kind that you don't have to yell over to have a conversation). The bathroom was stocked with brand name shampoo, conditioner, and lotion.\\n\\n  Our next stop was the smoking area. Normally, smokers feel as though they have been marooned to a small place behind the dumpster...but not here! Provided was 2 sets of swinging benches; set far enough away so that it did not disturb the guests in rooms around the area but no a 10 mile hike for those adults who enjoy the pleasure. Did I also mention they have smoking rooms available?\\n\\nIn the morning, feel free to partake in a complimentary breakfast (NOT CONTINENTAL)-I mean a real breakfast which changes daily; anything from fresh made waffles to eggs, sausage, and bacon! Also, cold cereal, juices, and coffees have options! Coffee is available 24/7 as well! \\n\\nThe hotel also has a pool and hot tub which I personally observed them clean daily!\\n\\nOn our last night we got back late and I was going to ask the desk for a late check out, but there was no need! Their check out time is 12:00 Pm as opposed to the hotel usual of 11:00 Am. That worked out well for us.\\n\\nAt checkout we were asked if there was anything we would change about the hotel or our stay. I made small suggestions which I thought would help them, but definitely nothing major. The desk person wrote down what I said and said she would pass it on! I was impressed with that, because we've been asked about our stay at other places, but it seemed more out of routine than actual interest. Here, she seemed genuinely interested.

Our driver Stacie gave us a history of the surrounding area and a lot of cool information on our way to the plantation. Laura Creole plantation had an amazing history. Our guide there was Ethan and he did a really good job explaining about the owners journey to this land and how the slaves were treated and also their journey. We felt that it was a balanced historical view of the plantation in general. After that tour we went to the Oak Alley plantation. The grounds alone are worth the trip. The tour guides really focus on the landowners and not so much on the lives of the slaves living there. But you have some time after the tour to visit the  slave quarters on your own. But we wished that there would have been a more balanced explanation of both experiences like at the Laura Plantation. The buses are big and you can recline and take a nap on your way back to the hotel. (No car sickness) \\n\\nSWAMP TOUR: 4 STARS and we didn't even see any alligators! This would have been a five-star tour if we would have seen alligators. But our guide Henry was very thorough and explained a lot of great details about the surrounding area. We got to see some boars, raccoons, and birds. It started to rain with thunder and lightning so we did not see any alligators because we had to go back for safety reasons. We did try to see some alligators but they don't come out if it's cold. Don't book your tour if it's cold or storming and I'm sure it will be a 5 star tour for you.

And, I should note, some of the best bartenders. \\n\\nAs my wife and I sat at the bar waiting for our friends to arrive, I marveled at the infinite selection of whiskeys and bourbons. I decided that this, self, is the day you will begin liking whiskey. So I petitioned the bartender to \"make me something awesome with whiskey in it.\" \"What kind of drink do you want?,\" he inquired. \"I have no idea, good sir. You see, I am a neophyte, a tyro, and fledgling when it comes to spirits such as these.\" (Perhaps my banter wasn\\'t quite at this level at the time; I was already a few drinks in from my visit to Franklin Mortgage, but this is how I remember it going.) So, he thought about it for a while and proceeded to mix up the craziest drink I had ever seen -- it had whiskey, orange bitters, an egg white, Portuguese red wine, and other stuff in it! The verdict: delicious. I also had the \"The Commodore\" off the drink menu, and it was very good, too. The drinks are a little pricey here, and they will set you back around $11 or $12 each.\\n\\nWhen our friends arrived, we were seated outside and I got to try to village burger and the short-rib and cheddar duck-fat fries. The burger, which comes with an artfully restrained dollop of homemade thousand island dressing, was unbelievable. The applewood bacon and the dressing served the elevate the already-incredible taste of the meat. I can\\'t wait to come back and order another one. As for the fries, they were very good, but I think next time I will stick with the plain duck fat fries. Our friends ordered those, and they were super crispy and delicious.\\n\\nWarning: this place gets insanely busy, so you might have to wait a pretty long time for a table. \\n\\nAll in all, the drinks were great, the food was delectable, and the staff was very knowledgeable and personable.

I am really glad I chose them.\\n\\nFirst off their place is really clean and professional, you feel more like you are in a bank or a business office than a body shop.  I don\\'t mind the typical \"shop\" feel of most of these places, but the experience at Prestigious is a notch above that and I appreciated it.\\n\\nNext off, they assigned a specific advisor, Juan Mendez to work with me from start to finish through my repair.  He was really knowledgeable and provided detailed information to me about how they were going to diagnose everything and ensure that all of the various components of the damage were fixed correctly.  There was an added challenge in my case because I was hit in nearly the same place by two different drivers:  one submitted a claim through insurance and the other asked to pay outside of insurance.  I explained all of this to Juan and he came up with a forensically defensible way to determine the value of the damage caused by each of the accidents so that the costs could be assessed fairly and accurately.\\n\\nJuan set up my rental for me and kept me updated regularly throughout the repair process, which in my case took a while due to the insurance company requiring additional evaluations etc. and the Thanksgiving holiday.  Detailed updates, and the fact that these came to me without me having to ask for them, made it a lot less stressful during the time my car was in the shop.  Juan (and I believe all the other staff who hold similar positions over there) also clearly understands all of the procedures, and deviations that can occur from these procedures, that are related to processing insurance claims and he was always able to answer any questions I had.\\n\\nI got the vehicle back yesterday and the quality of the work is 1st class.  There is no way to tell that anything ever happened to the back of my car...it looks exactly as it did when I purchased it in late July.  I was particularly concerned about paint matching because all of the exterior damage was to the bumper (a plastic part) which had to be matched to the car body panels (metal parts).  Anyone who knows anything about paint and body work knows that it is a challenge to match paints on different substrates, and most body shops, even Prestigious, have disclaimers about this that are plainly visible in their offices.  I told them up front I was really concerned about this, and they said not to worry.  They were right....they did a dead-perfect color match in my case.  I have mild OCD and I notice even the smallest differences and defects in things, and I was 100% satisfied with the paint match, as well as the gap tolerances etc. on my repair.  If a place can meet my standards, it is going to far surpass most people\\'s standards.\\n\\nIt sucked to get hit twice in two weeks, in a brand new car....but I am thrilled that I found this place as part of the deal.

I can only speak for the manicure/pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage. Typically, you go to a spa to escape and relax - you can not do that here. It is small, dirty, and the staff is terrible. \\n\\nI walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there, but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally, after two other guests came in behind me, someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water/refreshments of any kind. I\\'ve had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client, which I didn\\'t mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn, the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady, you are touching my hands with yours, you are blowing bacteria into the air, if you are that sick don\\'t come to work - *Management, if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients. \\n\\nShe gave me the worst hand/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone\\'s favorite part, and the technician\\'s opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied, and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just \"drinking up all the lotion.\" Yes, I realize it\\'s dry, probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside, but thank you for making me feel self-conscious. \\n\\nWhen I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again, but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge, which resulted in extra fees but I didn\\'t care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes, everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!! \\n\\nOverall, it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon. My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn\\'t even been a week.

And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn\\'t yet received our order.

Trainers really aren\\'t \"personal\" trainers. They have a set program that they put people through and you have very little to say about what you like/don\\'t like. The trainers work with several people in a session so depending on how many people are in a session you could be waiting for the trainer to get back to you or waiting for the person in front of you to finish. One of the things that frustrated me is they want you to push through the routine they have come up for you in the hour\\'s time. The sessions are hard with ropes, sleds, balls, bands, cables, weights and the most uncomfortable stationary bike I\\'ve ever had to sit on (and they make you end every session on the thing). No two sessions are alike - so if you like variety then great, if you like consistency or at least enough repetition to get the moves and form down then not so great. I seldom found a session to be fun or enjoyable, rather I often felt like I was a contestant on the Biggest Loser. They also play hip-hop all day long and you either like it or you don\\'t. The environment and training is designed (in my opinion) to appeal to 20-30yo demographic.\\n\\nIf you really want to push yourself beyond your limits and don\\'t care how you get there then you might really enjoy the MBSC program. If you want a professional personal trainer to spend quality time with you in achieving your goals and if you want a training program that you actually learn what muscle groups you are working and not just to be pushed through a routine then you probably won\\'t like MBSC. Definitely do a introductory program because the usual 30 day notice from the contract date applies if you cancel and it\\'s $200+/mo program.', 'date': '2014-01-17 17:38:39'}, {'review_id': 'cp12LEo_c7SNbpscnbYjfA', 'user_id': '1sgV5TOLiKCCi84No37qCA', 'business_id': 'qONvIS94nZhXYm-jccXyuw', 'stars': 3.0, 'useful': 1, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 1, 'text': \"Four stars for price. \\nI drive truck, so I've eaten bbq all over America.

The rooms are spacious, modern and gorgeous. \\nThe decor is chic and attractive: big wooden desk, hardwood floors, couches and throw pillows: Looks more like a friend\\'s apartment than a hotel. \\n\\nFree breakfast is always a plus for those of us with limited time. It\\'s not a hot breakfast (I\\'ve had so many mass-produced bad ones, so I\\'m not complaining) but greek yogurt, a huge croissant, an orange and some cranberry juice hits the spot! They leave it at your door though, instead of ringing your bell to wake you. So if you ask for it to be delivered at 7 a.m., check outside your door; by 7:01 it WILL be there. \\n\\nCoffee, a variety of teas, cold and hot water, as well as ice and a bowl of assorted fruit are available 24/7 in the lobby. There are doorbells for each room, and the hotel can only be accessed after hours if you have a key card. Floors are acessible with a keycard as well, for extra protection. The staff is very polite: one of the few places in Philly where someone will actually say \"good morning\" to you (No, seriously. I lived there for 5 years, so trust me on that). They\\'re also extremely helpful. When I checked in the night before, the gentleman at the reservation desk called to make sure I had a cab waiting for me at 8:15 the next morning so that I could make my speaking engagement on time. While I was getting my clothes ready, my iron was making more wrinkles than it was taking out, so I asked them for a new one and within 30 seconds, I had a brand new model with all the bells and whistles.\\n\\nI\\'ve read a few reviews talking about the noise level of this place. My room was closest to the reception desk and I never heard a peep. There were people out and about, but I didn\\'t hear a thing. And I\\'m a very light sleeper...\\n\\nA few things to note:\\nIts location on a tight, one way street can cause a little difficulty if you\\'re traveling solo, but if you have one person to unload the car while someone else parks, you should be fine. The parking garage they use is about half a block from the hotel, but you have to drive in a big rectangle to get there. \\n\\nThere\\'s a stand-up shower instead of the traditional bathtub/shower combo. It fits one comfortably enough... provided that you\\'re not too far from average height and build. (My boyfriend is 6\\'2 with a football player build and he made out okay.)\\n\\nDon\\'t expect much of a view. The view from our room was of the side of another building. But that\\'s what the city is for... go out there and see something!\\n\\nOverall, this was an excellent trip and a great find. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone.', 'date': '2016-02-23 21:31:39'}, {'review_id': 'Lo2giVeSNDvatEAGZRikWQ', 'user_id': 'YwMD-AVT67fmYRGxnlRSPA', 'business_id': 'alUk6OwNhofyc90NDMDY-Q', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 7, 'funny': 1, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Was taken here today by a Colombian friend who needed to satisfy a craving for something cheap and delicious.

(I think it has changed management more than once). The quality of there muffins has gone down so badly. Their Banana Nut was my absolute fave. It was the bomb. It tasted like my mom's homemade banana bread - super moist, tons of banana flavor, and plenty of nuts. I also use to enjoy the Carrot Cake muffin. It also tasted homemade. \\nI've had both kinds of muffin recently and they were awful. So bad that my husband forgot I didn't like them anymore and he brought me one on Saturday and I refused to eat it. I just couldn't force myself to do it. \\nBoth flavor of muffin tasted weirdly the same. They tasted like the same batter/mix was used for both and they actually tasted like it could possibly be the same base they would use for a corn muffin. Both the carrot and banana muffins were dry and tasted almost exactly the same. Both had nuts and the carrot cake one had a weird glaze topping instead of the usual delightful cream cheese frosting. I don't know if the muffin mix comes from corporate like this awful concoction or if it's the franchisee cutting corners to save money, but either way both muffins are a horrible representation of this company. \\n\\nAnd one other note - the customer service has also gone downhill. I get that on the weekends, it's probably high school kids working that don't want to be there but a company needs to know who they put into positions as their representation of their company. The staff always acts completely put out by customers ordering food. They take no pride in their work. Again, this is just to let the owner know how their employees reflect on their business.

You can't believe how amazing they were.  I noticed a family that had just finished breakfast food coveting our burgers and I even over heard them ask their server about them.  They reminded me of some of the first burgers I had ever had as a child from a lunch counter.  It's been over twenty years since I tasted any burgers as good as they were.

Go Vertical has some advantages and disadvantages compared to the others, but overall I wasn\\'t thoroughly impressed.  Maybe I expected too much from \"Philadelphia\\'s only rock climbing gym, and the largest of its kind on the east coast\".  While it\\'s the only gym in the city, there are plenty of other options in the burbs.  If I lived or worked in the city, I\\'m sure I\\'d join GV.  But I work out in KoP, so Oaks it is.\\n\\nIn regards to the \"largest of its kind\" claim, that is probably GV\\'s best asset.  There are over 200 routes, and plenty of top-roping and lead options.  The lead arch that spans over the gym is impressive, though I didn\\'t do any leading during my visit.  Plenty of top rope routes to choose from, and the 50 ft high section of wall was unique.  The overhanging bouldering section was small (lots of problems, but close together so only about 3 people could be on the wall at the same time.. I imagine this gets crowded).  However, they also have bouldering all over the gym, just watch out for other climbers.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t impressed with the route setting though.  Routes seemed unnecessarily difficult and lacked footholds. On easier routes I found myself simply muscling moves b/c there weren\\'t footholds or I couldn\\'t see a clean way to do a move.  On more difficult routes for me I\\'d fall sometimes, not b/c the move was too difficult, but b/c the move was awkward or didn\\'t have sufficient footholds.\\n\\nNot crowded for a saturday afternoon.  There were plenty of people there (~30?) but the gym is spacious and we didn\\'t have a problem finding a variety of open stuff to climb.\\n\\nIn regards to other yelpers comments: The staff were friendly (only interacted with a girl and guy at the desk), and the ropes and holds did seem on the older/dirty side.\\n\\nParking note: Apparently they used to own the lot next door, hence the \"plenty of free well-lit parking\" claim on their site.  But Sugarhouse casino took over all the lots, and you can\\'t park there without going to the casino (think they patrol the lots and tow).  There\\'s free street parking around the gym, but I can see it being difficult to park during more crowded times.', 'date': '2011-01-27 16:49:38'}, {'review_id': '3UUN6-33ZLspm0K36hsD9A', 'user_id': 'ke_64n5NQD3UyFMHEIE9Bg', 'business_id': 'lrowppSl2sk3hU4tSUaS6Q', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'Amazing food and service! had the chicharrones, amazing!

I would also come here only under very casual circumstances...lunch, happy hour, Sunday afternoon food/beer date with friends, or if I just wanted specific seafood and was in the area. I would not celebrate any special occasions here as the atmosphere is plain. Read on for deets.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\n- Small restaurant. Pretty quiet. About 6-8 tables of varying size total. Orange/warm colored walls. Little to no decor.\\n- Very simple, ultra casual style. Good place to go if you want seafood, but don\\'t feel like dealing with high-end prices or pretension.\\n- They played really romantic-ish music while we were there which was strange for the restaurant since it\\'s very casual and it was NYE. Gave me the impression they tried to make up for the plain walls with the music.\\n- Quiet atmosphere. I could comfortably talk to my dinner date without yelling. \\n- Because of the size of the restaurant, the 2-seater table we sat at was really awkwardly placed.\\n- Clean bathroom.\\n\\nFood:\\n- I ordered 6 raw oysters as an appetizer ($9), and lobster and beef tenderloins for entree ($30). \\n- The oysters were very good. In my mind, it\\'s hard to screw up something raw! They came chilled over ice with lemon and a marinara sauce (standard). Shells about 3-3.5\" size - good size.\\n- The entree came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Lobster was a good size, but not tender enough. Beef was over cooked. Side vegetables were very good. Asparagus cooked right and bright green, and mashed potatoes, standard comfort food fare.\\n\\nService:\\n- The owner/head waitress/hostess (small place, so not sure) was very friendly. We had trouble spotting the restaurant from the street (it\\'s very small and tucked in between a couple businesses) and called the restaurant for help. The owner saw us at the corner and navigated us to the restaurant over the phone.\\n- Our waiter was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed or distracted. Missed standard cues such as: introducing himself, clearing empty plates or glasses from table, didn\\'t leave us with salt and pepper on the table (had to flag him down), served lobster without drawn butter (had to flag him down). \\n- Spilled my martini on the table.\\n- Waiter also spilled water in front of our table and splashed us. Not too big of a deal, it was just water, but he already striked out a couple times.\\n- I mentioned that the beef was dry and all he did was quickly mumble, \"Sorry.\"\\n\\nDrinks:\\n- Ordered their specialty winter drink, an apple cinnamon martini ($8/9) and then a mango martini ($8/9). \\n- Apple cinn drink was unique, but I wouldn\\'t order it again.\\n- Mango martini tasted like it was made from actual juice.

There were bits of blueberry throughout and the flavors were spot on authentic, without excessive amounts of sugar to mask the flavor!

However, once I get off the Groat Bridge I'm never sure where to go. As they encourage so many people to cycle to the event, they need a designated bike lane into the park. If you walk your bike in with the pedestrians then you overshoot the bike parking area because the walkway is fenced off and then you have to back track. If you ride on the road, the lanes are separated by cones so they are very narrow and you have to go in the bus lane.

I called the office around 10:45 to find out when they would be arriving since they had missed their appointment. I was told the operator would try to contact the installation crew & find out.

They did not call me because they did not have my paperwork with my phone number. If they did not have my paperwork with my phone number, how were they even going to find my address?

Bryan then told me that he would get back to me on the same day to let me know when he could get me on the calendar for an installation. I never heard from Bryan again after that phone call.\\n-On Saturday, 6/15, I received 5 missed calls and a voicemail from Darrel saying that he was loading my windows for installation, but because it was raining the caulk would not be able to dry so he would not be able to do the installation.

I was apprehensive to even write a review because the condition of my hair in the beginning was due to me being bored during this pandemic and impatience. But I was not satisfied with the end result, especially after spending around $280. \\n\\nThere were a couple of things I was not happy with and I felt maybe the biggest part lacking was communication and that is vital in any service role. \\n\\nMy hair was damaged, I bleached a lot of it myself and I also have hair that has had dark dyes added for years so the lighting process was sure to be hard plus there was color correction needed. Michelle told me that my hair was compromised but she would do her best to get it to where I wanted it to go, which we both understood may not happen today. That was fine, I know I can't take damaged hair that is half light brown still after 3 bleaches and half blonde and expect an even platinum. \\n\\nI showed up at my arrival time, but ended up waiting an hour to get started because she had another client. I took this in stride because I knew that the industry can be like that at time. I finally sat down and we talked and discussed my hair and goals. \\n\\nI told her I knew it was damaged and I wanted to chop it all off and my goal is platinum with silver and some lavender. She wanted to cut it first and then work on the color. We started the bleaching process. After that we rinsed and she mixed up color. Now, at this point I think communication went out of the window. She brought up 3 bowls and when she started applying what looks like a very violet color, I asked if she was toning it and she said yes. I was ok with that, because she applied it to my roots and I was a little concerned I was going to have some violet hair which was the opposite of what I was asking for. \\n\\nNow, she also added a smokey color to the ends, in an attempt to not only mask the brassiness but also because even though she was able to pull the ends from the much darker brown, it wasn't platinum yet and we both figured that wold happen. \\n\\nWe went to rinse, and this is hour FIVE at this point, somewhere at 7:00pm for a 2:00pm appointment. It was my birthday this day and I had people waiting on me at the house and I was pretty much ready to go and Michelle was working a double so we were both at the end of a long day. \\n\\nWe go back to the chair and my roots are violet purple. The mid parts of my long pixie style cut, the top/bang part are much lighter, a bit brassy but that was understandable. You can't create miracles on compromised hair. \\n\\nWe went forward to dry and finish the cut. She thought I wanted something different, we ended up taking some more hair off the sides and it still wasn't quite what I was looking for so I pulled out my phone again. This was another place communication was lacking. We should of talked much more on the hair cut so that we didn't go back and forth so much, I began to feel that Michelle was starting to get a bit frustrated because I wasn't happy with the look of the short style. Mind you, I just went from slightly past the shoulder length hair to a very short style with bangs. So at this point I did want to just finish and I tried to talk to her about how I actually wanted my hair and about next time are we gong to be able to get the purple out and do it more toward the ends because that's what I actually wanted. I felt that she was done with me at this point, and to be honest after 5-6 hours on one head, I understood to a degree and I also wanted to get home for my birthday festivities. She added a texturized to my hair, it gave me the look I wanted and we parted ways. I get home, and of course my husband gave me compliments as dd my friends but my husband talked to me later and said he didn't know I was going for something so dark and he thought I was mainly going for platinum blonde with lavender and silver. I told him that was the goal and we can't get to it so fast, but that I also didn't know why I had violet purple roots. \\n\\nI asked her at the end if taking this purple out would be a problem and she said it wouldn't. But I will definitely talk to her and tell her my side of things and also ask that we communicate before doing anything involving color or cut and be sure we understand one another. \\n\\nMy advice to anybody is to communicate fully, don't assume that because the stylist is talented that she knows exactly what you want. This was our first visit together and we have to learn one another like any relationship but I am not fully satisfied and feel that the color could have been avoided with better communication.\\n\\nHad I known when I asked if she was toning my hair that it was actually a violet dye, I would have tried to fix it then but after so much time went by it was past the point of fixing my hair and fixing color that day.\", 'date': '2020-12-05 14:35:01'}, {'review_id': 'tyGewEnrXZvE1q7xAri7kg', 'user_id': 'Lt7xSv-7QIhKrctrXEwvxA', 'business_id': 'uP42QDUxC2lxz15BUDbFnA', 'stars': 1.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"Horrible from the time I made the reservation.

I received my text the day before to confirm which I did but was worried about the sitting so I called the restaurant back again to make sure having 7 not 6 people would not be an issues. I was told you should be fine but if there was a problem ask for the manager. Not the answer I wanted but I said fine because this is where my son wanted to go. We got there last night (7:30 reservation) I went to the hostess and was asked if the 7 of us wanted to sit in a 6 person booth I said no there were 7 adults, I was told I then needed to be put on a waiting list since I had more people. Needless to say I was not happy and went over how many times I called to make sure 7 people would be fine. I was then seated at a long table which was perfect but then it went down hill from there.

Water brought to the table when we sat at 7:30 we left at 9:30 - no water ever refilled and never asked if we wanted any drinks. Took our apps and dinner order together my son then asked for a drink as well as my husband. My sons came but not my husbands. Sat for an hour finally 6 of the 7 dinners came out - they forgot my sons order - we thought his just wasn't done until the waiter came back awhile later to ask if everything was ok. His meal did not come out until we were all done.  We were so frustrated and angry by the end no one even wanted dessert. They said they would take his meal off the bill. Bill arrived they took one steak off but still charged us for his first order so nothing taken off and charged us for a second drink we never received.  The manager came over to question why we were questioning the bill but he did not realize the whole issue with my sons meal. I was absolutely done at this point. The manager apologized and also took my sons apps and  drinks off as well. I never asked he just said he would. On top of it we drove an hour for this fiasco with my 80 year old parents. I wouldn't give it one star but you can't post without one.\", 'date': '2021-10-23 10:25:21'}, {'review_id': 'LxhTE3N8q6A88SzlYiNAAw', 'user_id': 'o8bMu6olYtIUE0RZr80PMQ', 'business_id': '1b5mnK8bMnnju_cvU65GqQ', 'stars': 4.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': \"I'm always a little wary when going to a place that's been so hyped up that the wait is longer than the overall experience.

When I went into get it figured out \"Amanda\" the manager told me she couldn\\'t help me. She said The employee that did this to us had been fired because he was fraudulently doing this so he could get credit, he had done this to multiple people  and that she talked to the district manager and that he wasn\\'t willing to do anything either. I tried contacting the district manager. No luck! I called sprint fraud department and they couldn\\'t get the district manager to call them back to figure out what was going on. once they get you to sign the paperwork you are screwed and you are held to a two-year lease.

I am talking to my lawyer this week to see if there is any legal action I can take against this store to help stop them from doing this to other people.

She said they attempted delivery, but no one was at the house.  I let her know that my son was stationed at an army base and that her explanation doesn't make sense because there's always someone there.   I told her I'd be down to the store to discuss further and that I need to get the package to him. \\n\\nBefore going to the store, I looked up the delivery history from the tracking number. It showed that the delivery driver made one attempt and no one was there so they dropped my box off to a UPS Access Point and waited to see if my son would come to pick it up before returning it back to the Campbell/Prince UPS Store.\\n\\nFirst of all, my son is in basic training on an army base and cannot leave.  Secondly, why would they have not made 3 attempts to deliver the package?\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the store to discuss what transpired, the store manager Luisa was extremely dismissive. I asked her why the address was indicated as a residential address and why was only one attempt made to deliver the package?  She said that's up to UPS how they handle things. I told her that's her company,  could she look into this for me?  Again, she was dismissive and treated me like I was keeping her from something. There were only 2 customers in the store (myself and another person that was being helped by one of the other 2 associates in the store and who was not happy with the way she was being treated and overcharged)  so, I'm not sure why Luisa was treating me this way. \\n\\nShe said she'd be willing to ship it for me, but wouldn't cover the costs; I'd have to pay full price to ship out again.  I asked her if I could get a discount or something because this was not my fault,  I was paying for a service that was not fully accomplished by her company.  Again  she didn't care and was dismissive. I asked if we could file a claim to get my money or some of it back.  She told me she'd have to call to file it since it was sent out of her store.  I assumed she'd call them in front of me to make me confident that she was doing something about this or at least tell me that she'd contact me with a resolution.  No,  she simply walked away to the back as if I was keeping her from something vital. \\n\\nHer lack of customer service and dismissive attitude is the reason I left the store, drove further to the Wetmore store and sent my package from there. \\n\\nLuisa is in the wrong position.  She is in a customer service industry, yet shows zero care for her customers. If I was the franchise owner I would be frightened about the amount of business they're losing due to Luisa. I'm only saying this because within my visit, the only 2 customers in that store were both very unhappy with the way we were both treated (we discussed outside after exiting the store on the way to our cars). I  can't imagine how many times per day this occurs with Luisa in charge. \\n\\nAnyone reading this.. go to the Wetmore store between Stone and 1st. The franchise owner works out of that store, and is very nice, patient, and actually likes his customers.  He was willing to help me out with my transaction and listen to my story to ensure I wouldn't be dealing with an Access Point issue again, since I never requested that service to begin with.

She got a new client while my top coat was drying so when I asked her to clean them up she rushed and still left a lot behind for me to clean off myself when I got home. Given that they were so busy I wasn't going to make a fuss and was going to try and call to schedule to come back in so they had time to actually fix them. I went back today (the next day) to try and get them filed down more and to look more natural. Unfortunately Me was the one to do them again ... while they looked a little better they still weren't great. As soon as the rain hit my nails when leaving the top coat got these weird white splotches ...I sat under the dryer so they should have been dry and she told me I could leave. Typically after my dip is filed down there is a sealant or something that is put on before the top coat. I don't know if because she didn't do that it caused the issue.  They also look rough with file lines all in them versus smooth like they usually are.

I planned on grabbing a couple drinks to go and heading home, but I saw the waffle ice cream concoctions on the menu and thought that it would be much better to eat-in. Every waffle looked amazing, but the \\n\"Rainbow In My Hand\" with cotton candy ice cream, gummies and mochi\\'s really caught my eye.\\n\\nThe saying \"explosion of flavor\" is cliche, but I don\\'t know any other more accurate way to describe this. You got creamy, sour, sweet, mushy, hard and dense in every bite. It\\'s quite a lot for your taste buds to process, but I liked it. With that being said, I\\'d opt for something like the Cookielicious or the Snow White next time, just for a bit more continuity.\\n\\nAlso, my coconut boba smoothie and her taro milk tea were both top notch.\\n\\nBut then as we were leaving, my wife pointed out a sign off to the side that showed ice cream boba\\'s.

To top it off the frozen squid strips tasted slightly freezer burned. I think the chef (and I use the term loosely) may have been trying to cover up the fact that the squid were slightly off by making them taste sweet like good fresh squid should be.

Who knows. \\n\\nAnyways, we started out with a few appetizers to get the night going. I had a small bowl of Tom Yum soup, which I am always a sucker for and tuna avocado salad. The soup didn't have enough lemongrass in it for my taste, but it was still decent. But, the tuna avocado salad---boy, that was so good! Let me be clear, this isn't canned tuna, but rather delicious Ahi tuna. And they weren't skimpy with the avocado either! I would suggest ordering this!\\n\\nUnfortunately, the entrees didn't give as much punch as the tuna avocado salad. My partner ordered the drunken noodles and asked for it to come spicier, but neither the flavor or the spice deliver. Whomp. I ended up with panang curry with tofu. Again, we asked for that dish to come spicier. It didn't come as spicy as we wanted.

That is when we stumbled in to Sea Critters.\\n\\nIt seemed that they were preparing for some sort of karaoke event, but we made our way through to find an open table on the outside back dock. With the open water, parked boats and smell of seafood, we felt right at home.\\n\\nWe arrived in time for their daily Happy Hour and took advantage of their $3.50 margaritas. They hit the spot. While waiting, our server brought a complimentary loaf of ciabiatta bread with a Mango Cherry chutney butter. The bread was fresh and very warm.

Boasting to be caught wild in Plant City, I found myself questioning the validity of that claim. Realistically, who cares? And how do you back that up? We\\'re in Florida. Home of the Gators. They\\'re everywhere! These were served up hand-breaded, fried and with a side of horseradish sauce. Pretty tasty, but much smaller in size than what I was hoping for.\\n\\nI ordered the \"Hog Wings\". The menu describes them as \"fall-off-the-bone tender pork shanks served Buffalo or BBQ Style\". I chose the Buffalo style. Honestly, it was Franks red hot sauce. Again, small quantity. I found myself wishing I had about twice as much... And I\\'m not a heavy eater.

Then we moved on to the gambas al ajillo (amazing flavor), gambas a la parrilla (amazing los delish), batatas bravas (potatoes on a creamy sauce \"spicy\" according to them but is not at all... and its a must), albondigas (meat balls), almejas, ox tail (so tender and flavorful), chorizo al brandy and that was a perfect meal for 3.

I have been obsessed with Porta Pizza. I have been there a lot this past summer and I can't get enough! They surprise me every time I come in for dinner or drinks. \\n\\nPorta has a very rustic appearance with bright lights and music that intrigue you to go in. I have been here several times for dinner and drinks. Porta's pizza is fantastic. I seriously cannot get enough. Some of the pizzas I have tried is the Carbonara Pizza, Margherita, Festivus, 14 & a half pizza, House Party, and Chenzino pizza. I have clearly tried too many of the pizzas on the menu but they are all excellent. I think the Carbonara pizza is still my all time favorite, but you won't be disappointed with any of the pizzas on the menu. \\n\\nThe appetizers are also very good. I am a huge fan of the Many-Thanks Sliders and Meatball Sliders. Some of the other times that I have been to Porta were for the drinks. This summer they are doing The Twice is Right Tuesday's. Every Tuesday you can enjoy a bar crawl to four different bars in Porta Pizza and another connecting bar. At the end of the night, once you have you have all four punches in your punch card, you have a chance to win a prize! Some prizes include gift cards, free drinks, etc. I had a lot of fun during the bar crawl and met a lot of new people.  \\n\\nLastly, Porta just opened up the top Mezzanine. At the mezzanine, you can enjoy a great view overlooking Porta pizza, sit at the bar and listen to the DJ while enjoy some amazing artwork that is up there. I think Porta is a great option to go to any time of the week.

My friend was right - the cheesesteaks were among the best we\\'ve had outside of Philly and New York, and we were disappointed to find the next time we visited Enterprise that New York Richie\\'s had closed that location.\\n\\nSo you can imagine my excitement when Cindi called me on the way home from work one evening a few weeks ago to tell me there was a New York Richie\\'s sign at the old Round Table / Atza pizza location on Glenwood Street across from Hawks Stadium.  According to some posts on the Oregon New York Richie\\'s Facebook page, there was no business connection between the Idaho and Oregon New York Richie\\'s locations, but the food would be the same.  We stopped in today, their second day of business, to see just how close the food came to what we had enjoyed so much in Enterprise.\\n\\nI\\'m happy to report that we were not disappointed.  The cheesesteaks were as good as we remembered - the meat was tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of grilled onions, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and Swiss and provolone cheeses.  The bread was fresh and chewy, as good as we\\'ve had in Philly, if a little smaller in diameter than authentic Philly steaks.  The fries were crispy and well seasoned, and included Richie\\'s trademark chipotle fry sauce.  While we were eating, we saw a monster 20\" thin crust cheese pizza make its way to the next table, and made a mental note that we had to try the pizza on our next visit.\\n\\nOur only disappointments:  First, the price.  At $8.95 for a sandwich with no fries, Richie\\'s is charging $2-3 more than Philly prices for their steaks.  (In fairness, the pizza prices seemed very reasonable, starting at $16.50 for the 20\" cheese pizza.)  Secondly, any place that claims to serve genuine Philly cheesesteaks needs to have Cheez Whiz available as a topping option.\\n\\nBut all in all, we\\'re happy as can be to finally have a real cheesesteak available in Boise.', 'date': '2011-05-01 02:12:35'}, {'review_id': 'CphIcLTNU26TDb_YTOSgUQ', 'user_id': 'Is5IWDXWtqVMCVtedjJIQQ', 'business_id': 'VOITl4HlmC1EGJ_wVMS6_w', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 0, 'funny': 0, 'cool': 0, 'text': 'I compete in Jiu-Jitsu and every competition I feel confident in my ability to outperform my competition.

I see Marhaba as a 3.5-star eatery, but I'll round up due to the dearth of Lebanese/Egyptian food in the area, and I did not have the owner/head chef present, so I'm sure things would be ticked up a half point were he available in the kitchen.\\n\\nFirst off, the location is kind of cool off the river, but the restaurant is small on the borderline annoying side.  Tables are quite close together.  There were only about three other tables occupied when we went for lunch, and one server covered the whole shift.  There was one young guy as a chef working the kitchen.  He seemed good, but I didn't get the sense that the dishes were special as if the owner were present.  Someone with some background and skill put together this wonderful menu.\\n\\nService is chillax in a good way.  My DP and I sampled a few things off the menu and found everything good, but there were no wows per se (i.e. not a 5-star eatery).  \\n\\nMarhaba does its own take on a number of Lebanese dishes, but still have a lot of core items and dipping sauces, which I liked very much.  The portions are large, which the menu mentions.  I found them overly large, tbh.\\n\\nHere's what I had:\\n\\nKaffa Brad - they serve this freshly puffed, and it's quite good.  I'm used to it being served with hummus or salatim, which wasn't the case here.  It was just a stack of very good bread.  I think a lot of people would like this though.\\n\\nLentil Soup with Fried Onions - Very rich, tasty dish.  I liked the spices and they added some heat.  The fried onions added a savory element and a different texture, although once they soaked up the soup they lost their crispness.\\n\\nChicken Schwarma Platter - So good.  Chicken was tender and well spiced and a very large portion to boot.  I thought the yellow saffron rice was too flavorful and crowded out some of the chicken flair.  I'm used to the chicken being served a top white basmati rice, which may flow together a bit more naturally.  The side Mediterranean salad was nice and bright, although I'm not as big on olive oil as most.  The chicken schwarma came with two sauces, tahini and a garlic, very classic.  I added their famous green hot sauce since I'm a sucker for some kick.  All were great and tasted homemade.\\n\\nMy DP got the lamb gyro, which was tasty, very meaty and came on a fresh pita.  He had some sauce envy, however, when he saw my accompaniments.\\n\\nNext time I might try the lamb chops or lamb kebab to see how juicy they push their proteins.\\n\\nOne other note, try not to sit by the door in the winter, as the draft can be cumbersome.  Prices are inexpensive.  It's BYOB.\", 'date': '2015-01-23 23:52:03'}, {'review_id': 'H0RIamZu0B0Ei0P4aeh3sQ', 'user_id': 'qskILQ3k0I_qcCMI-k6_QQ', 'business_id': 'jals67o91gcrD4DC81Vk6w', 'stars': 5.0, 'useful': 1, 'funny': 2, 'cool': 1, 'text': 'Latest addition to services from ICCU is Apple Pay for ICCU debit and Credit cards.

These are the best calzones, hands down, t hat I\\'ve ever eaten. Crust is flavorful and baked to that golden-brown, crispy-chewy perfection that satisfies the soul. And there isn\\'t *too much* of it -- it\\'s always perfectly filled, to every single corner, with melty, gooey, cheesy goodness. It comes with a variety of truly homemade-tasting sauces, all of which I\\'d be proud to have made myself, from the simple garlic butter to the roasted-tomato smoky goodness of the thick red sauce. \\n\\nBut the standout, here, is the fillings. Creative and epic combinations, combining sweet and savory, spicy and creamy, rich and fresh and smoky... again, these are characteristics I seek in my own kitchen, my own recipes, which I take a great deal of pride in. \\n\\nSo! Last night His Goatness and I binged on the Carmen, the Figgy Piggy, and the Garden. \\n\\nThe Carmen: Prosciutto, Capicola, Spinach, Parmesan, Fontina, Ricotta, Garlic Oil. So much flavor, even from the various cheeses, and the garlic oil wasn\\'t buried... it allowed a perfect melding of flavor, with a bit of freshness from the spinach. Warm and creamy. Served with garlicky garlic butter. \\n\\nThe Figgy Piggy: Applewood Smoked Bacon, Figs, Balsamic Onions, Garlic Herb Cheese, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Garlic Honey Oil. Dear gods, I love the combination of figs, balsamic onions, and bacon. The perfect blend of sweet and savory... this was far and away my favorite, and will be a treat I savor many times in the future. It was served, again, with simple garlic butter, allowing the ingredients to shine -- I didn\\'t use it. It wasn\\'t necessary. There wasn\\'t too much crust. \\n\\nThe Garden: Balsamic Eggplant, Spinach, Zucchini, Roasted Garlic, White Onions, Snow Peas, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Garlic Oil. I substituted artichoke hearts for snow peas -- the snow peas (which I do love) didn\\'t seem quite in harmony with the Mediterranean ingredients. They were generous with the artichoke hearts, and the whole thing came together flawlessly. It was served with their smoky, thick \"House Red\" sauce, which complemented the calzone marvelously. \\n\\nA blowout binge that was worth. Every. Calorie.

I for one have never had a burger with an egg and the thought of it isn't very appealing. \\n\\nI ended up ordering the 'Pharmacy Burger', which is a less cheesier version of their 'Cheese Burger' that my husband ordered. They LOADED the mustard, but that really wasn't what I didn't like about it. It really wasn't that I disliked the burger, it just wasn't anywhere near one of the best burgers that I've had. The extra toppings at fifty cents each are pretty skimpy too. I was a fan of the wasabi aioli though. I also loved the tater tots though. I highly recommend ordering tater tots over the french fries. The beer cheese dipping sauce was an extra dollar and was borderline disgusting. Stick with wasabi aioli. \\n\\nI'm thinking that the toppings and sauces are possibly what the hype about this place is, otherwise, I just don't get it.
